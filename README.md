Thank you for looking at my GIF and OMDB page!

The goal of this page was to help learn the basic understanding of API calls, along with learning AJAX from jQuery.

## https://vilagen.github.io/api/

This page was designed in mind as a way to look up
gifs from Giphy's website. Ideally, TV shows and
movies are what were in mind when initially created, 
but technically anything can be entered on the giphy
input tab, including actors, videogames, or any other
interest. Gifs will appear 10 at a time. Click on the 
image to play the gif, and click again to pause.

The second input tab is for the OMDB API. This is just
a quick way to find information about your favorite TV
show and movies, such as what it is rated, plot, actors,
and even Metacritic score.

Hope you have fun with this page.
